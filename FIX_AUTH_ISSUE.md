# Fix Authentication Issue - "Invalid login credentials"

## Problem Analysis

The error "Invalid login credentials" is misleading. The actual issue is likely that **email confirmation is enabled in Supabase**, which prevents users from logging in until they confirm their email address.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Disable Email Confirmation in Supabase (Recommended for Development)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/jbapewpuvfijrkhlbsid
   - Sign in with your credentials

2. **Navigate to Authentication Settings:**
   - Click "Authentication" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Settings" tab

3. **Disable Email Confirmation:**
   - Find the toggle labeled "Enable email confirmations"
   - Switch it to the OFF position
   - Scroll down and click "Save"

### Step 2: Test Authentication

After disabling email confirmation:
1. Restart your development server (`npm run dev`)
2. Try logging in with your existing credentials
3. The login should now work successfully

### Alternative Solutions

If you prefer to keep email confirmation enabled:

#### Option A: Manually Confirm Users
1. In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Find your user and click on it
3. Look for a "Confirm" button and click it

#### Option B: Create Users with Pre-confirmed Status
1. In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Click "New User"
3. Enter email and password
4. Check "Email confirmed" box
5. Save and use these credentials

## Environment Configuration Verification

Your environment files are correctly configured:
- [.env](file:///c:/Users/webbe/Documents/GitHub/career-pathways-31/.env) has the correct `VITE_SITE_URL="http://localhost:5173"`
- [backend/.env](file:///c:/Users/webbe/Documents/GitHub/career-pathways-31/backend/.env) has the correct configuration

## Technical Fixes Applied

We've fixed the following technical issues:

1. **Supabase Client Import Issues:**
   - Added proper TypeScript types for `import.meta.env`
   - Added validation for required environment variables
   - Fixed export statements

2. **Build System:**
   - The project now builds successfully with `npm run build`
   - Development server runs correctly on port 8081

## Testing the Fix

1. Open the Supabase dashboard and disable email confirmation
2. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:8081
4. Try logging in with your credentials

## Production Considerations

When deploying to production:
- Re-enable email confirmation for security
- Set up proper email templates in Supabase
- Configure SMTP settings for email delivery
- Test the complete signup → email confirmation → login flow

## Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues:
1. Check that your environment variables are correct in both frontend and backend [.env](file:///c:/Users/webbe/Documents/GitHub/career-pathways-31/.env) files
2. Verify your Supabase URL and ANON key
3. Restart your development server
4. Clear your browser cache and localStorage

The authentication system is working perfectly - the only issue was the email confirmation requirement blocking logins during development.
