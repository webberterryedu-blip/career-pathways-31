# ðŸš€ Git Push Resolution Guide

## Current Issue
Your git push is being blocked by GitHub's secret scanning because a GitHub Personal Access Token was detected in commit `6f2a23520714340ee3fe608b868b8900405dd84f` in the file [FIXED-mcp.json](file://c:\Users\webbe\Documents\GitHub\career-pathways-31\FIXED-mcp.json).

## Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Allow the Secret (Recommended)
Since you've already removed the secret from the current codebase, simply allow this specific secret through GitHub's interface:

1. **Click the link** from the error message:
   ```
   https://github.com/webberterryedu-blip/career-pathways-31/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/331ZzNpjPMhfcJcXWyjRd6bZD2k
   ```

2. **Review and confirm** that this secret is no longer in use

3. **Allow the secret** to proceed with the push

### Step 2: Retry the Push
After allowing the secret, retry your push:
```bash
git push origin main --force
```

## Alternative Solutions (If Step 1 Doesn't Work)

### Option A: Create a New Branch
1. Create and switch to a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-main
   ```

2. Push the new branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin new-main
   ```

3. Change the default branch on GitHub to `new-main`

4. Delete the old problematic branch

### Option B: Contact GitHub Support
If you continue to have issues, contact GitHub support for assistance with the secret scanning block.

## Prevention for Future

1. **Never commit actual secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
3. **Store secrets in `.env.local`** (which is gitignored)
4. **Provide `.env.example`** files for team members
5. **Enable GitHub Secret Scanning** for early detection

## Files That Were Fixed
The following files have been updated to remove hardcoded secrets:
- `mcp-config-fix.json` - Now uses environment variable references
- `.gitignore` - Added patterns to prevent committing sensitive files
- `.env.local.example` - Template for environment variables
- `README.md` - Documentation on secret management
- `SECURITY_FIX_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive security guide

The system is now properly configured to use environment variables instead of hardcoded secrets.
