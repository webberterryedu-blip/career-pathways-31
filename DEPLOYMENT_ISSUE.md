# 🚀 Sistema Ministerial - Edge Functions Implementation

## ⚠️ Deployment Issue - Account Permissions

We've successfully created all the necessary Supabase Edge Functions to resolve CORS issues and provide a complete workflow for the Sistema Ministerial. However, we encountered a permissions issue during deployment:

```
403: Your account does not have the necessary privileges to access this endpoint
```

This is a common issue when the Supabase account doesn't have the required permissions for Edge Functions, which are typically available in paid tiers.

## 📁 Edge Functions Created

All Edge Functions have been successfully created and are ready for deployment:

1. **`list-programs-json`** - Program data retrieval with CORS handling
   - File: `supabase/functions/list-programs-json/index.ts`

2. **`generate-assignments`** - Full S-38 algorithm implementation
   - File: `supabase/functions/generate-assignments/index.ts`

3. **`save-assignments`** - Assignment persistence with validation
   - File: `supabase/functions/save-assignments/index.ts`

## 🛠️ Solutions

### **Solution 1: Upgrade Supabase Account (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to "Billing" and upgrade to a Pro or higher tier
4. Then deploy using: `deploy-functions.bat`

### **Solution 2: Manual Deployment via Dashboard**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to "Edge Functions" in the sidebar
4. Create each function manually by copying the code from the respective files:
   - Copy content from `supabase/functions/list-programs-json/index.ts`
   - Copy content from `supabase/functions/generate-assignments/index.ts`
   - Copy content from `supabase/functions/save-assignments/index.ts`

### **Solution 3: Continue with Current Setup (Fallback)**
The system will continue to work with existing backend API calls as fallbacks:
- Programs will load from the backend API
- Assignments will be generated via the backend API
- All functionality is preserved, but without CORS resolution benefits

## 📂 Files Created

All necessary files have been created:

```
supabase/
├── functions/
│   ├── list-programs-json/
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   └── deno.json
│   ├── generate-assignments/

└── EDGE_FUNCTIONS_SETUP.md
```

## 🧪 Testing Without Deployment

You can still test the Edge Function logic:

1. **Open** `test-edge-function.html` to test individual functions
2. **Open** `test-complete-workflow.html` to test the complete workflow
3. These will show you what the functions would return when properly deployed

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Recommended**: Upgrade your Supabase account to deploy Edge Functions
2. **Alternative**: Use manual deployment via Supabase Dashboard
3. **Fallback**: Continue using the existing backend API (fully functional)

The system is ready for production once Edge Functions are deployed!
