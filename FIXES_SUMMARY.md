# Ministry Hub Sync - Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Port Conflict Between Frontend and Backend
- **Problem**: Both the frontend (Vite development server) and backend were trying to use port 3000
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed backend port from 3000 to 3001 in [backend/.env](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/.env)
  - Added `VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"` to [.env](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/.env) to point frontend to correct backend URL

### 2. Missing Environment Variable Configuration
- **Problem**: Frontend was defaulting to `http://localhost:3000` for API calls because `VITE_API_BASE_URL` was not defined
- **Solution**: Added `VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"` to [.env](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/.env)

## Verification

The `/api/designacoes/generate` endpoint is now accessible and responding correctly:
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3001/api/designacoes/generate`
- **Status**: Working (returns appropriate error messages for invalid data)
- **Previous Error**: `404 Not Found`
- **Current Status**: Properly handling requests

## How to Test

1. Ensure backend is running on port 3001:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. Ensure frontend is running (typically on port 8080):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to the Designations page and try generating assignments

## Additional Notes

- The backend routes were already correctly implemented in [backend/routes/designacoes.js](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/routes/designacoes.js)
- The route registration in [backend/server.js](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/server.js) was correct
- The issue was purely a configuration problem with port conflicts and missing environment variables

## Files Modified

1. [backend/.env](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/.env) - Changed PORT from 3000 to 3001
2 [.env](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/.env) - Added VITE_API_BASE_URL pointing to backend on port 3001
