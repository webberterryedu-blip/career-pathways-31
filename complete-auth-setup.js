ðŸš¨ COMPLETE AUTHENTICATION SETUP - STEP BY STEP ðŸš¨

THE ISSUE: You're getting "Invalid login credentials" because there are NO users in your Supabase authentication system.

SOLUTION: Follow these exact steps to set up your authentication system:

1. OPEN SUPABASE DASHBOARD
   ======================
   URL: https://app.supabase.com/project/jbapewpuvfijrkhlbsid
   Sign in with your Supabase account

2. DISABLE EMAIL CONFIRMATION (RECOMMENDED FOR DEVELOPMENT)
   ======================================================
   - In the left sidebar, click "Authentication"
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Find "Enable email confirmations" toggle
   - Switch it to OFF (gray position)
   - Scroll down and click "Save"

3. CREATE YOUR FIRST USER
   =====================
   - In the left sidebar, click "Authentication" > "Users"
   - Click the "New User" green button
   - Fill in EXACTLY:
     * Email: admin@test.com
     * Password: Admin123!
   - CHECK the "Email confirmed" box (important!)
   - Click "Save"

4. VERIFY USER CREATION
   ===================
   - You should now see "admin@test.com" in the users list
   - The status should show "Email confirmed: Yes"

5. CREATE A PROFILE FOR THE USER
   ============================
   - In the left sidebar, click "Table Editor"
   - Click on the "profiles" table
   - Click "Insert" to add a new row
   - Fill in:
     * id: (leave as auto-generated UUID)
     * user_id: (copy the user ID from the auth users table for admin@test.com)
     * email: admin@test.com
     * nome: Admin User
     * role: admin
     * created_at: (current timestamp)
     * updated_at: (current timestamp)
   - Click "Save"

6. RESTART YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER
   ==============================
   - In your terminal, stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run: npm run dev:all

7. LOGIN TO YOUR APPLICATION
   ========================
   - Go to: http://localhost:8080/auth
   - Enter credentials:
     * Email: admin@test.com
     * Password: Admin123!
   - Click "Login"

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
If you still get "Invalid login credentials":

1. Double-check that you:
   - Created the user with EXACT email and password
   - Checked "Email confirmed"
   - Created a profile with matching user_id

2. Check your .env files:
   - Frontend .env should have correct VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - Backend .env should have correct SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

3. Verify Supabase project settings:
   - Site URL should be: http://localhost:8080
   - Redirect URLs should include: http://localhost:8080/**

This is the complete solution to your authentication issues!
