‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Your development server runs on port 8080 (npm run dev:all)
- Your Supabase URL is correct: https://jbapewpuvfijrkhlbsid.supabase.co
- The JWT key is properly configured
- Email validation rules may be rejecting certain domains

The first option (disabling email confirmation) is the fastest fix for development.
