// This script provides information on how to confirm a user
console.log(`
To confirm the test user we created, you have a few options:

1. Check your email for a confirmation message from Supabase
   - Look for an email sent to test.user@organization.com
   - Click the confirmation link in the email

2. If you don't have access to that email address, you can:
   - Log into your Supabase dashboard at https://app.supabase.com
   - Go to your project
   - Navigate to Authentication > Users
   - Find the user with email test.user@organization.com
   - Click on the user and look for a "Confirm" button or option

3. For development purposes, you can temporarily disable email confirmation:
   - In the Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > Settings
   - Find the "Enable email confirmations" setting
   - Toggle it off (note: this is not recommended for production)

Once the user is confirmed, you should be able to log in with:
Email: test.user@organization.com
Password: testpassword123
