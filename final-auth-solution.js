üîê FINAL AUTHENTICATION SOLUTION üîê

Based on our previous testing, we found that:

‚úÖ Password "13a21r15" works for frankwebber33@hotmail.com
‚ùå Password "senha123" does not work

This confirms the issue is with using the wrong password, not with the authentication system itself.

IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:
===================

1. TRY LOGGING IN WITH:
   Email: frankwebber33@hotmail.com
   Password: 13a21r15

2. IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE PASSWORD:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
   - Find frankwebber33@hotmail.com
   - Click on the user
   - Select "Reset Password"
   - Set a new password you'll remember

3. CREATE A NEW TEST USER (Recommended):
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
   - Click "New User"
   - Enter:
     * Email: test@example.com
     * Password: Test123456!
   - Check "Email confirmed"
   - Click "Save"
   - Use these credentials to login

VERIFICATION STEPS:
==================

1. Open your application at http://localhost:8080
2. Go to the login page
3. Try the working credentials above
4. If successful, you'll be redirected to the dashboard

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
===============

The error "Invalid login credentials" is misleading. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with:
- Your code implementation (it's correct)
- Your Supabase configuration (it's working)
- Your environment variables (they're properly set)

It simply means the password you entered doesn't match what's stored in Supabase for that user.

PREVENTION FOR FUTURE:
=====================

1. Keep a record of test credentials
2. Use a password manager for development accounts
3. Always reset passwords through the Supabase dashboard when in doubt
4. For development, create simple test users with easy-to-remember passwords

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check that email confirmation is disabled in Supabase settings
2. Verify your .env files have the correct VITE_SITE_URL (http://localhost:8080)
3. Restart your development server
