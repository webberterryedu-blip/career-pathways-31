ðŸ”§ COMPLETE REDIRECT URL FIX FOR SUPABASE ðŸ”§

ISSUE: Email confirmation links redirect to localhost:3000 instead of https://emt.lovable.app/

IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:

1. UPDATE SUPABASE DASHBOARD CONFIGURATION:
   ========================================
   Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/jbapewpuvfijrkhlbsid/auth/url-configuration

   Site URL:
   - Current: http://localhost:3000
   - Change to: https://emt.lovable.app/

   Redirect URLs (add if missing):
   - https://emt.lovable.app/**
   - http://localhost:8080/**
   - http://localhost:3001/**

2. UPDATE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   ============================
   In your frontend .env file, add:
   VITE_SITE_URL=https://emt.lovable.app/

   In your backend .env file, update:
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://emt.lovable.app/

3. RESTART YOUR SERVERS:
   =====================
   npm run dev:all

4. TEST THE FIX:
   ==============
   - Create a new user through the signup form
   - Check your email for the confirmation link
   - The link should now redirect to https://emt.lovable.app/auth
   - Complete confirmation and login

This will ensure that all authentication flows properly redirect users to your production application URL instead of localhost.
