# üö® IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: PASSWORD RESET REQUIRED

Based on your error and the profile data you've shared, your profile is correct but you're still getting "Invalid login credentials". This is now definitely a **password issue**, not a profile issue.

## üîç DIAGNOSIS CONFIRMED

‚úÖ Profile exists and is correct:
- user_id: 1d112896-626d-4dc7-a758-0e5bec83fe6c
- email: frankwebber33@hotmail.com
- nome: Frank Webber
- role: instrutor

‚ùå But authentication is failing with "Invalid login credentials"

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE

You're using the **wrong password** for an existing account. This is the most common cause of this specific error when the profile is correct.

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS (Try in Order)

### OPTION 1: RESET YOUR PASSWORD IN SUPABASE DASHBOARD

1. Go to https://app.supabase.com/project/jbapewpuvfijrkhlbsid
2. Click "Authentication" > "Users"
3. Find your user (frankwebber33@hotmail.com)
4. Click the three dots menu > "Reset Password"
5. Set a new password you'll remember (e.g., "Test1234!")
6. Restart your server and try logging in

### OPTION 2: CREATE A NEW TEST USER

1. Go to Authentication > Users in Supabase dashboard
2. Click "New User"
3. Email: test@system.com
4. Password: Test1234!
5. Check "Email confirmed"
6. Save
7. Run this SQL in SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO profiles (user_id, email, nome, role, created_at, updated_at)
   SELECT id, 'test@system.com', 'Test User', 'instrutor', NOW(), NOW()
   FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'test@system.com';
   ```
8. Login with test@system.com / Test1234!

### OPTION 3: CLEAR SERVER CACHE AND RESTART

1. Stop your server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear browser cache/cookies for localhost:8080
3. Run: npm run dev:all
4. Try logging in again

## üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPER TOOLS FOR DIAGNOSIS

Since you have VITE_ENABLE_DEVELOPER_PANEL=true in your .env, you can:

1. Open your app in the browser
2. Look for the Developer Panel (usually in the bottom right)
3. Use the "Diagnose Auth" button to get detailed information
4. Use the "Fix Profile" button if needed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

- Your email is already confirmed (based on previous data)
- Email confirmation is NOT the issue
- Profile creation is NOT the issue
- This is specifically a password/authentication issue

## üìû IF THESE SOLUTIONS DON'T WORK

Contact your Supabase project administrator to:
1. Verify your account status
2. Check if there are any auth policies blocking your login
3. Manually reset your password through the dashboard

Try these solutions in order. The issue is almost certainly with the password, not the system configuration.
