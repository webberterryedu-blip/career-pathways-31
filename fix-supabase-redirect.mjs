ðŸ”§ SUPABASE URL CONFIGURATION FIX ðŸ”§

ISSUE: Email confirmation links are redirecting to localhost:3000 instead of https://emt.lovable.app/

SOLUTION: Update your Supabase URL Configuration

STEPS TO FIX:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard:
   https://app.supabase.com/project/jbapewpuvfijrkhlbsid/auth/url-configuration

2. Update the Site URL:
   - Current: http://localhost:3000
   - Change to: https://emt.lovable.app/

3. Add your domain to Redirect URLs (if not already there):
   - Click "Add URL"
   - Enter: https://emt.lovable.app/**
   - Save changes

4. Also add these redirect URLs for development:
   - http://localhost:8080/**
   - http://localhost:3001/**

5. Save all changes

After making these changes:
- Email confirmation links will redirect to https://emt.lovable.app/
- Your development environment will still work on localhost:8080
- Your backend API will work on localhost:3001

This will fix the email confirmation redirect issue and ensure users are sent to the correct location after confirming their email.
