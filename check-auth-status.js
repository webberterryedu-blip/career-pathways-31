   - Click "Settings" tab

3. CHECK EMAIL CONFIRMATION SETTING:
   - Look for "Enable email confirmations" toggle
   - If it's ON (green), that's causing your login issues
   - For development, turn it OFF

4. SAVE CHANGES:
   - Scroll down and click "Save"

5. RESTART YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER:
   - Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run: npm run dev

6. TEST LOGIN:
   - Go to http://localhost:8081
   - Try logging in with your credentials

COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:

   - Usually means email confirmation is required but not completed
   - Solution: Disable email confirmation in Supabase settings

‚ùå Redirect URLs pointing to localhost:3000:
