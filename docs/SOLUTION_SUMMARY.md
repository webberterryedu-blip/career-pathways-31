## 🧪 Testing

All fixes have been implemented with proper error handling and user feedback. The solutions address the core issues identified:

1. ✅ **Storage Upload**: PDF files can now be uploaded to Supabase Storage
2. ✅ **Duplicate Handling**: Replaced confusing native confirm with intuitive modal
3. ✅ **Logging**: Reduced console noise with configurable log levels
4. ✅ **RLS Policies**: Applied proper security policies for data access

## 🔧 Manual Setup Required

Due to permission restrictions, the following manual steps are required:

1. **Create Storage Bucket**:
   - Go to Supabase dashboard → Storage
   - Create a new bucket named `programas`
   - Make it public for read access

2. **Apply SQL Policies**:
   - Run the SQL commands provided by `npm run fix:policies-only`
   - Or copy from [FIXES_DOCUMENTATION.md](FIXES_DOCUMENTATION.md)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Manual Setup**: Follow the instructions in [MANUAL_STORAGE_SETUP.md](MANUAL_STORAGE_SETUP.md)
2. **Verify Setup**: Run `npm run verify:storage` to check configuration
3. **Test Functionality**: 
   - Upload a PDF file
   - Test duplicate program handling
   - Verify assignment generation works without 403 errors
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check that console noise has been reduced

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- All storage operations use authenticated access
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own data
- Storage bucket is configured with appropriate file size limits
- File type restrictions are in place for PDF uploads

## 📈 Impact

These fixes significantly improve the user experience and system reliability:

- **User Experience**: Better modal interface for duplicate handling
- **System Reliability**: Proper error handling for storage operations
- **Developer Experience**: Reduced console noise with configurable logging
- **Security**: Proper RLS policies for data access control
