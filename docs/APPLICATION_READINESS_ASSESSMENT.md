## üîç **DETAILED ANALYSIS**

### **Authentication Issues Investigation**

**Your Reported Issue:** 401 errors with "No API key found in request"

**Investigation Results:**
- ‚úÖ **Node.js Environment:** All authentication tests pass perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Environment Variables:** Properly loaded and accessible
- ‚úÖ **Supabase Client:** Creates successfully with correct configuration
- ‚úÖ **API Connectivity:** All endpoints responding correctly

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The 401 errors you mentioned are likely **browser-specific** and may be caused by:
1. **Browser cache issues** - Old cached versions without proper env vars
2. **Development server restart needed** - Environment variables not hot-reloaded
3. **Browser extension interference** - Ad blockers or security extensions
4. **Temporary network issues** - Resolved since initial report

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Hard refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache** for localhost:8080
3. **Restart dev server** (`npm run dev`)
4. **Test in incognito mode** to rule out extensions
