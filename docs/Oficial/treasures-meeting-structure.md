# Treasures From God’s Word – Meeting Structure and Assignments

The Treasures From God’s Word meeting provides a structured program for instruction, discussion, and practical application of Bible principles, with specific guidance for elders, ministerial servants, and students.

## 1. Talk (10 minutes)

Delivered by an elder or qualified ministerial servant, the talk follows the theme and outline in the Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook. When a new Bible book is introduced, a video may be shown. Speakers may connect the video to the theme but must cover all points outlined. Artwork and other references may be used to enhance understanding.

## 2. Spiritual Gems (10 minutes)

This question-and-answer segment is managed by an elder or ministerial servant. No introduction or conclusion is needed. The audience answers briefly (around 30 seconds), and the speaker decides if Bible verses should be read aloud. The goal is to engage the audience and reinforce scriptural knowledge.

## 3. Bible Reading (4 minutes)

Handled by a male student, the reading must be accurate and fluent, without introduction or conclusion. The chairman emphasizes proper pronunciation, stress, modulation, and natural pausing. Assignments should match students’ abilities.

## 4. Apply Yourself to the Field Ministry (15 minutes)

Students practice ministry, including conversation, teaching, and preaching. Elders may assign points from the Teaching or Love People brochures. Discussion segments may be scheduled, led by elders, to improve reasoning and engagement skills. This section develops practical ministry experience.

## 5. Starting a Conversation

Students of either gender practice initiating meaningful discussions, with an assistant of the same gender or a family member. Assignments focus on natural conversation, relevant Bible truths, and preparing for future discussions.

## 6. Following Up

Students demonstrate how to revisit previous conversations. The assistant should match the student’s gender. The goal is clarity, naturalness, and effective follow-up techniques.

## 7. Making Disciples

Students present a segment of an ongoing Bible study. Introduction or conclusion is unnecessary unless specified. The focus is on conveying study material clearly and modeling effective teaching methods.

## 8. Explaining Your Beliefs

Male students handle talks on thematic questions, while demonstrations may be performed by either gender. Students provide tactful answers using reference material as needed. Assistants are of the same gender or family members.

## 9. Talk (Student Assignment)

Male students present talks based on the Love People brochure. Depending on the lesson, they highlight how specific verses apply in ministry, explaining their meaning, use, and reasoning approach. The focus is practical application.

## 10. Content and Settings for Student Assignments

Students in “Starting a Conversation” or “Following Up” share simple Bible truths relevant to the listener. Assignments are adapted to local circumstances using three settings:

1. House to House – Door-to-door preaching and follow-ups.
2. Informal Witnessing – Sharing scripture in everyday situations.
3. Public Witnessing – Preaching in public spaces such as streets, parks, or businesses.

Students may feature videos or literature, introducing and discussing content without playing it.

## 11. Living as Christians

After a song, a 15-minute segment includes parts helping the audience apply Bible principles. Assignments may go to elders or ministerial servants, with discussions encouraging audience participation. Brief interviews, if needed, are preferably conducted from the stage.

## 12. Congregation Bible Study (30 minutes)

Led by a qualified elder, this segment ensures thorough review of assigned material. Elders are selected for their ability to preside, keep the study on time, emphasize key scriptures, and highlight practical applications. Different conductors and readers may be used weekly. If time is limited, the chairman may direct abbreviation, with the conductor determining which parts to omit while maintaining focus on essential points.

## Conclusion

The Treasures From God’s Word meeting combines structured teaching, student participation, and practical ministry application. Elders, ministerial servants, and students all contribute to a dynamic and interactive program, fostering understanding, communication skills, and effective application of biblical principles in daily life.
