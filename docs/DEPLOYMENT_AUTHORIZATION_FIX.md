# 🚨 Deployment Authorization Error Fix

## 🐛 Issue Description

**Error Message**: "You are not authorized to perform this action"  
**Context**: Attempting to publish/deploy the site  
**Platform**: Lovable (sua-parte.lovable.app)

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

This authorization error typically occurs due to one of the following reasons:

### 1. **Lovable Account Authentication Issues**
- Session expired or invalid
- Account permissions changed
- Two-factor authentication required

### 2. **Project Ownership Issues**
- Project transferred to different account
- Collaborator permissions revoked
- Organization membership changes

### 3. **Platform-Specific Issues**
- Lovable service temporary outage
- API rate limiting
- Billing/subscription issues

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix Guide

### Step 1: Verify Lovable Account Access

1. **Check Lovable Dashboard Access**:
   ```
   1. Go to https://lovable.dev
   2. Sign in with your account
   3. Verify you can see your projects
   4. Look for "sua-parte" project
   ```

2. **Verify Project Ownership**:
   ```
   1. Click on the "sua-parte" project
   2. Check if you have "Owner" or "Admin" permissions
   3. Look for publish/deploy buttons
   ```

### Step 2: Re-authenticate with Lovable

1. **Sign Out and Sign Back In**:
   ```
   1. Sign out of Lovable completely
   2. Clear browser cache and cookies for lovable.dev
   3. Sign back in with your credentials
   4. Try publishing again
   ```

2. **Check Two-Factor Authentication**:
   ```
   1. Verify 2FA is working if enabled
   2. Use backup codes if needed
   3. Update authenticator app if required
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Project Configuration

1. **Check Project Settings**:
   ```
   1. Go to project settings in Lovable
   2. Verify deployment configuration
   3. Check custom domain settings (sua-parte.lovable.app)
   4. Ensure no conflicting configurations
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   ```
   1. Check all required environment variables are set
   2. Verify Supabase credentials are correct
   3. Ensure no sensitive data is exposed
   ```

### Step 4: Alternative Deployment Methods

If Lovable continues to have issues, you can deploy to alternative platforms:

#### Option A: Vercel Deployment

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   # Build the project
   npm run build
   
   # Deploy with Vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   vercel env add VITE_SUPABASE_URL
   vercel env add VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   ```

#### Option B: Netlify Deployment

1. **Install Netlify CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   ```bash
   # Build the project
   npm run build
   
   # Deploy to Netlify
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

3. **Configure Redirects** (create `public/_redirects`):
   ```
   /*    /index.html   200
   ```

#### Option C: GitHub Pages Deployment

1. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   
   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
           with:
             node-version: '18'
         - run: npm install
         - run: npm run build
         - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
           with:
             github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             publish_dir: ./dist
   ```

## 🛠️ Auto-Fix Script

Create this script to automate the deployment process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deployment-fix.sh

echo "🚀 Sistema Ministerial - Deployment Fix Script"
echo "=============================================="

# Check if build works
echo "📦 Building project..."
npm run build

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Build successful"
else
    echo "❌ Build failed - fix build errors first"
    exit 1
fi

# Try Vercel deployment
echo "🌐 Attempting Vercel deployment..."
if command -v vercel &> /dev/null; then
    vercel --prod
    echo "✅ Deployed to Vercel"
else
    echo "⚠️ Vercel CLI not installed"
    echo "Run: npm install -g vercel"
fi

# Try Netlify deployment
echo "🌐 Attempting Netlify deployment..."
if command -v netlify &> /dev/null; then
    netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
    echo "✅ Deployed to Netlify"
else
    echo "⚠️ Netlify CLI not installed"
    echo "Run: npm install -g netlify-cli"
fi

echo "🎉 Deployment attempts completed"
```
