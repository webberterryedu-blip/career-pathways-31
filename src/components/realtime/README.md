- Shows optimistic update count
- Displays connection state (connected, disconnected, syncing, updating)
- Configurable display modes (icon-only or with text)

#### ConflictResolutionPanel (`src/components/realtime/ConflictResolutionPanel.tsx`)
- Handles conflicts between optimistic updates and server state
- Provides user interface for resolving conflicts
- Shows pending updates with timestamps
- Allows users to accept or reject conflicting changes

### 2. Assignment Communication System (Subtask 5.2)

#### AssignmentCommunicationService (`src/services/assignmentCommunication.ts`)
- Comprehensive service for assignment-related communications
- Notification delivery for assignment creation, updates, and cancellations
- Automatic reminder scheduling (1 week, 3 days, 1 day before)
- Feedback collection system
- Integration with database for persistent notifications

#### useAssignmentCommunication Hook (`src/hooks/useAssignmentCommunication.ts`)
- React hook for integrating communication service with UI
- Handles local notification display
- Manages real-time subscription to assignment notifications
- Provides methods for all communication operations

#### AssignmentFeedbackModal (`src/components/assignment/AssignmentFeedbackModal.tsx`)
- Modal interface for collecting assignment feedback
- Star rating system (1-5 stars)
- Predefined strengths and improvement areas
- Free-form comments section
- Structured feedback submission

#### ReminderManagement (`src/components/assignment/ReminderManagement.tsx`)
- Interface for managing assignment reminders
- Shows scheduled reminders with status
- Manual reminder sending capability
- Reminder deletion and modification
- Integration with notification system

### 3. Timing and Counsel Tracking (Subtask 5.3)

#### TimingInterface (`src/components/meeting/TimingInterface.tsx`)
- Meeting chairman timing interface
- Precise timing controls with start/pause/stop functionality
- Visual progress indicators and time warnings
- Session management for multiple meeting parts
- Overtime detection and alerts
- Meeting summary with total times

#### CounselTracker (`src/components/meeting/CounselTracker.tsx`)
- Structured counsel recording system
- Rating system for assignment evaluation
- Predefined strengths and improvement categories
- Next steps recommendations
- Follow-up scheduling
- Integration with assignment completion workflow

#### AssignmentPerformanceAnalytics (`src/components/analytics/AssignmentPerformanceAnalytics.tsx`)
- Comprehensive performance analytics dashboard
- Student progress tracking across multiple metrics
- Skill area analysis (preparation, delivery, timing, interaction, application)
- Trend analysis (improving, stable, declining)
- Automated recommendations based on performance data
- Visual charts and progress indicators

## Key Features

### Real-time Updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with server synchronization
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic detection and resolution of update conflicts
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicators of real-time connection state
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Automatic rollback of failed optimistic updates

### Communication System
- **Automatic Notifications**: Real-time notifications for assignment changes
- **Reminder Scheduling**: Automated reminders at configurable intervals
- **Feedback Collection**: Structured feedback system with ratings and comments
- **Multi-recipient Support**: Notifications for both students and assistants

### Timing and Counsel
- **Precise Timing**: Accurate timing with visual progress indicators
- **Structured Counsel**: Standardized counsel recording with predefined categories
- **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive analytics with improvement suggestions
- **Progress Tracking**: Long-term progress monitoring and trend analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Real-time Architecture
- **Supabase Real-time**: WebSocket-based real-time subscriptions
- **Optimistic Updates**: Client-side state management with server synchronization
- **Conflict Detection**: Timestamp-based conflict detection and resolution
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### State Management
- **Context Providers**: Centralized state management using React Context
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable hooks for common operations
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient re-rendering and memory management

### User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual indicators for all system states
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation when real-time features are unavailable
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant components with proper ARIA labels
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interfaces for all components

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component and service testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Mock Implementation**: Comprehensive mocking for external dependencies
- **Error Scenarios**: Testing of error conditions and edge cases

### Test Files
- `src/components/realtime/__tests__/RealTimeFeatures.test.tsx`: Main test suite
- Mock implementations for Supabase and authentication
- Conceptual tests for complex workflows

## Integration Points

### Existing System Integration
- **UnifiedLayout**: Real-time status indicators in the main layout
- **NotificationArea**: Enhanced notification display with real-time updates
- **AssignmentContext**: Extended with real-time capabilities
- **App.tsx**: NotificationProvider integration

### Database Schema Requirements
The implementation assumes the following additional database tables:
- `assignment_notifications`: For storing persistent notifications
