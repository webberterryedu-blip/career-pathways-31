## Services

### AnalyticsEngine
Core analytics service that processes data and generates metrics.

**Key Methods:**
- `calculateParticipationMetrics()` - Calculate student participation metrics
- `calculateAssignmentDistribution()` - Analyze assignment distribution balance
- `calculateStudentProgress()` - Track individual student progress
- `getAssignmentFrequencyAnalysis()` - Analyze assignment frequency patterns

### ReportExporter
Service for exporting reports in various formats.

**Supported Formats:**
- CSV (Excel compatible)
- JSON (data export)
- HTML (printable/PDF convertible)

## Data Models

### ParticipationMetrics
```typescript
interface ParticipationMetrics {
  studentId: string;
  studentName: string;
  totalAssignments: number;
  assignmentsByType: Record<string, number>;
  averageTimeBetweenAssignments: number;
  lastAssignmentDate: string | null;
  participationRate: number;
  skillDevelopmentScore: number;
}
```

### StudentProgressMetrics
```typescript
interface StudentProgressMetrics {
  studentId: string;
  studentName: string;
  assignmentHistory: AssignmentHistoryItem[];
  skillProgression: SkillProgressionItem[];
  improvementAreas: string[];
  strengths: string[];
  nextRecommendedAssignment: string | null;
}
```

### AssignmentDistributionMetrics
```typescript
interface AssignmentDistributionMetrics {
  totalStudents: number;
  activeStudents: number;
  averageAssignmentsPerStudent: number;
  assignmentDistributionBalance: number;
  underutilizedStudents: string[];
  overutilizedStudents: string[];
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Analytics calculations are performed on-demand to ensure fresh data
- Large datasets are paginated and processed in chunks
- Charts use responsive containers for optimal performance
- Data is cached temporarily to avoid redundant calculations

### Accessibility
- All charts include proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Color schemes are accessible with sufficient contrast
- Keyboard navigation is supported throughout
- Screen reader compatible content structure

### Responsive Design
- Charts automatically resize for different screen sizes
- Mobile-optimized layouts with collapsible sections
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Progressive enhancement for advanced features

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation addresses the following requirements from the specification:

- **8.1**: Participation tracking and analytics with comprehensive metrics
- **8.2**: Assignment distribution analysis with fairness calculations
- **8.3**: Individual student progress tracking with development insights
- **8.4**: Export functionality for reports and data analysis

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Real-time Analytics**: Live updates using Supabase subscriptions
2. **Advanced Visualizations**: More chart types and interactive features
3. **Predictive Analytics**: ML-based recommendations and predictions
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Cross-congregation comparisons
5. **Mobile App**: Dedicated mobile interface for analytics
6. **API Integration**: REST API for external analytics tools
