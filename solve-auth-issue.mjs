SOLUTION FOR AUTHENTICATION ISSUE:

The error "Invalid login credentials" typically occurs for one of these reasons:

1. INCORRECT CREDENTIALS
   - Make sure you're using the correct email and password
   - Check for typos in both email and password

2. EMAIL NOT CONFIRMED
   - If you recently signed up, check your email for a confirmation link
   - The email might be in your spam/junk folder
   - Supabase requires email confirmation before allowing login

3. USER DOESN'T EXIST
   - Make sure you've completed the signup process
   - Check that the signup was successful

IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:

Option 1: Create a new test user
   - Go to the signup page in the application
   - Enter valid credentials
   - Check your email for the confirmation link
   - Click the confirmation link
   - Then try logging in

Option 2: Use existing credentials
   - If you have existing credentials that worked before, try those
   - Make sure you're using the correct Supabase project URL

Option 3: Check Supabase Dashboard
   - Log into https://app.supabase.com
   - Go to your project
   - Navigate to Authentication > Users
   - Check if your user exists and is confirmed

For development, you can temporarily disable email confirmation:
   - In Supabase Dashboard: Authentication > Settings
   - Turn off "Enable email confirmations"

The enhanced error handling in the updated code will now provide clearer guidance about what's wrong.
