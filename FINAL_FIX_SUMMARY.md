# Final Fix Summary - Ministry Hub Sync

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Port Conflict Between Frontend and Backend
- **Problem**: Both frontend (Vite development server) and backend were trying to use port 3000
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed backend port from 3000 to 3001 in [backend/.env](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/.env)
  - Added `VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"` to [.env](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/.env) to point frontend to correct backend URL

### 2. Missing Environment Variable Configuration
- **Problem**: Frontend was defaulting to `http://localhost:3000` for API calls because `VITE_API_BASE_URL` was not defined
- **Solution**: Added `VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3001"` to [.env](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/.env)

### 3. Designacoes Endpoint 404 Error
- **Problem**: The `/api/designacoes/generate` endpoint was returning 404 Not Found
- **Root Cause**: The endpoint was looking for program data in the database tables (`programacoes` and `programacao_itens`), but the data was only available in JSON files
- **Solution**: Modified the designacoes endpoint in [backend/routes/designacoes.js](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/routes/designacoes.js) to:
  1. First try to load program data from the database
  2. If not found, load program data from JSON files in [docs/Oficial/programacoes-json](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/docs/Oficial/programacoes-json)
  3. Convert JSON data to the expected format for processing

### 4. Program Data Loading
- **Problem**: Program data was not being saved to the database, causing the designacoes endpoint to fail
- **Solution**: Added a new endpoint `/api/programacoes/save-from-json` in [backend/routes/programacoes.js](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/routes/programacoes.js) to save program data from JSON to the database

## Verification

The `/api/designacoes/generate` endpoint is now accessible and responding correctly:
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3001/api/designacoes/generate`
- **Previous Error**: `404 Not Found`
- **Current Status**: Properly handling requests and loading data from JSON files when not found in database
- **Current Error**: `500 Internal Server Error` due to Supabase API key issue (separate issue)

## How to Test

1. Ensure backend is running on port 3001:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. Ensure frontend is running (typically on port 8080):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to the Designations page and try generating assignments

## Remaining Issues

### Supabase API Key Issue
- **Problem**: The backend is unable to connect to Supabase due to an "Invalid API key" error
- **Impact**: Student data cannot be fetched, which is required for generating designations
- **Solution Needed**: Obtain the correct Supabase service role key from the Supabase dashboard and update it in [backend/.env](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/.env)

## Files Modified

1. [backend/.env](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/.env) - Changed PORT from 3000 to 3001
2. [.env](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/.env) - Added VITE_API_BASE_URL pointing to backend on port 3001
3. [backend/routes/designacoes.js](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/routes/designacoes.js) - Modified to load data from JSON files when not found in database
4. [backend/routes/programacoes.js](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/routes/programacoes.js) - Added endpoint to save program data from JSON to database
5. [backend/config/supabase.js](file:///C:/Users/webbe/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ministry-hub-sync/backend/config/supabase.js) - Updated environment variable loading

## Conclusion

The main issue reported by the user - that the designacoes endpoint was returning a 404 error - has been fixed. The endpoint is now properly handling requests and loading program data from JSON files when it's not available in the database.

The remaining issue with the Supabase API key is a separate configuration problem that needs to be addressed by obtaining the correct service role key from the Supabase dashboard.
