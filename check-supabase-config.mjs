SUPABASE AUTHENTICATION CONFIGURATION CHECK

Based on what I can see in your Supabase dashboard:

✅ SITE URL: http://localhost:3000
✅ REDIRECT URLs are configured properly
✅ JWT SECRET is available

ISSUES TO CHECK:

1. EMAIL CONFIRMATION SETTING
   - Go to Authentication > Settings in your Supabase dashboard
   - Look for "Enable email confirmations" 
   - If it's ON, that's likely causing your login issues
   - For development, you can turn it OFF temporarily

2. EMAIL PROVIDER CONFIGURATION
   - Go to Authentication > Providers
   - Check if Email provider is enabled
   - Make sure SMTP settings are configured (or use test mode)

SOLUTIONS:

OPTION 1: DISABLE EMAIL CONFIRMATION (Recommended for development)
   - In Supabase Dashboard: Authentication > Settings
   - Turn OFF "Enable email confirmations"
   - This will allow immediate login without email verification

OPTION 2: CREATE USER MANUALLY IN DASHBOARD
   - In Supabase Dashboard: Authentication > Users
   - Click "New User"
   - Enter email and password
   - Check "Email confirmed" to skip verification
   - Save and use these credentials to login

OPTION 3: UPDATE SITE URL
   - Your current site URL is http://localhost:3000
   - But your app might be running on http://localhost:8080 or http://localhost:8081
   - Update this to match your actual development server URL

Try these solutions in order and let me know which one resolves your issue!
