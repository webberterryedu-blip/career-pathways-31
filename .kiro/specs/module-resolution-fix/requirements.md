# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing multiple 404 errors when trying to load modules and components, despite the files existing in the file system. This indicates a module resolution or build configuration issue that prevents the development server from properly serving the application files. The system needs to be restored to a working state where all imports resolve correctly and the application loads without errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development server to properly resolve and serve all application modules, so that the application loads without 404 errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server starts THEN all component imports SHALL resolve successfully
2. WHEN accessing the application in the browser THEN no 404 errors SHALL occur for existing files
3. WHEN navigating to any route THEN all required modules SHALL load correctly
4. IF there are build configuration issues THEN they SHALL be identified and resolved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper module path resolution for all imports, so that TypeScript and the bundler can find all dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing components with @/ alias THEN the paths SHALL resolve to src/ directory
2. WHEN importing UI components THEN they SHALL be found in the correct locations
3. WHEN importing pages and contexts THEN all imports SHALL work without errors
4. IF path aliases are misconfigured THEN they SHALL be corrected

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to properly handle all file types and extensions, so that all assets are served correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build system processes TypeScript files THEN they SHALL be compiled correctly
2. WHEN serving static assets THEN they SHALL be accessible at the correct URLs
3. WHEN importing CSS and other assets THEN they SHALL be processed properly
4. IF there are missing build dependencies THEN they SHALL be installed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and diagnostics for module resolution issues, so that I can quickly identify and fix problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN module resolution fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided
2. WHEN debugging build issues THEN diagnostic information SHALL be available
3. WHEN fixing configuration THEN changes SHALL take effect immediately
4. IF there are dependency conflicts THEN they SHALL be resolved
