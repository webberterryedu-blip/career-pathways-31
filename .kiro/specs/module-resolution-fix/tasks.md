# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Clean up conflicting server processes


  - Identify all processes running on port 8080 using netstat command
  - Terminate conflicting development server processes using taskkill
  - Verify port 8080 is available for new server instance
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_



- [ ] 2. Clear all development caches and temporary files
  - Remove node_modules directory to clear dependency cache
  - Clear npm cache using npm cache clean --force
  - Remove any Vite cache directories (.vite, dist)


  - Clear browser cache and storage for localhost:8080
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1_

- [ ] 3. Reinstall and verify dependencies
  - Run npm install to reinstall all dependencies from package.json


  - Verify package-lock.json is generated correctly
  - Check for any dependency conflicts or missing packages
  - Validate that all required build tools are installed
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 4. Validate and fix build configuration files
  - Verify vite.config.ts has correct path aliases and server configuration
  - Check tsconfig.json for proper baseUrl and paths configuration
  - Ensure package.json scripts are correctly defined
  - Validate that all configuration files have valid syntax
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_




- [ ] 5. Test module resolution with diagnostic script
  - Create a simple test script to verify TypeScript can resolve @/ imports
  - Test that all major component imports work correctly
  - Verify that UI component imports resolve to correct paths
  - Check that context and page imports work without errors
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1_

- [ ] 6. Start development server with clean environment
  - Start Vite development server using npm run dev
  - Verify server starts successfully on port 8080
  - Check that server responds to health check requests
  - Confirm no startup errors in console output
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 7. Verify application loads without 404 errors
  - Test that main application loads at localhost:8080
  - Check browser console for any remaining 404 errors
  - Verify all component imports resolve successfully
  - Test navigation to different routes works correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 8. Create diagnostic and monitoring utilities
  - Write a script to check for common module resolution issues
  - Create a health check endpoint to verify server status
  - Implement error logging for module resolution failures
  - Add diagnostic information to help debug future issues
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 9. Test build process and production readiness
  - Run npm run build to test production build process
  - Verify all modules are bundled correctly without errors
  - Test that built application serves correctly with npm run preview
  - Confirm all assets are properly included in build output
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 10. Document resolution steps and prevention measures
  - Create troubleshooting guide for similar issues in the future
  - Document the root cause analysis and solution steps
  - Add preventive measures to avoid similar problems
  - Update development setup documentation with best practices
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_
