# Sistema Ministerial - System Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the Sistema Ministerial (Ministerial System) based on comprehensive analysis of existing documentation and codebase. The system is a complete platform for managing Theocratic Ministry School assignments for Jehovah's Witnesses congregations, featuring automated assignment generation, student management, program import, and PDF generation with S-38-T compliance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Page Flow and Specialization Optimization

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to optimize the page flow and specialization of each component, so that the system provides a more intuitive and efficient user experience.

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want improved interfaces and user experience flows, so that I can accomplish my tasks more efficiently and with less confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating the system THEN the user SHALL have clear visual indicators of their current location and available actions
2. WHEN performing complex operations THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guidance and progress indicators
3. WHEN encountering errors THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and recovery suggestions
4. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive experience across all screen sizes

### Requirement 5: Data Import and Export Optimization

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want optimized data import and export capabilities, so that I can efficiently manage large datasets and integrate with external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing student data THEN the system SHALL provide robust error handling and validation
2. WHEN exporting assignments THEN the system SHALL generate properly formatted PDFs and Excel files
3. WHEN processing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and cancellation options
4. WHEN handling data conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution options

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability Improvements

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the system to perform efficiently even with large datasets, so that I can work without delays or timeouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and lazy loading
2. WHEN performing complex calculations THEN the system SHALL optimize algorithms for better performance
3. WHEN handling concurrent users THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and prevent conflicts
4. WHEN scaling the system THEN the architecture SHALL support horizontal scaling

### Requirement 7: Security and Compliance Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want enhanced security measures and compliance features, so that sensitive congregation data is properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL enforce proper role-based access control
2. WHEN storing sensitive information THEN the system SHALL use appropriate encryption and security measures
3. WHEN auditing system usage THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive audit logs
4. WHEN handling user authentication THEN the system SHALL implement secure authentication flows

### Requirement 8: Integration and API Improvements
