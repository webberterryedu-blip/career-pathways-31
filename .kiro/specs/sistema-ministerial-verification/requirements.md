# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a comprehensive verification system that will systematically test and validate all components of the Sistema Ministerial to ensure everything is functioning as documented in the README.

5. WHEN testing authentication pages THEN the system SHALL verify login and registration forms are functional
6. IF any frontend component fails THEN the system SHALL report the specific component and error details
7. WHEN all frontend components are functional THEN the system SHALL report successful frontend verification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that the authentication system works correctly for all user roles, so that I can ensure proper access control is implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing admin authentication THEN the system SHALL verify admin users can log in and access admin dashboard
2. WHEN testing instructor authentication THEN the system SHALL verify instructors can log in and access instructor dashboard
3. WHEN testing student authentication THEN the system SHALL verify students can log in and access student portal
4. WHEN testing role-based access THEN the system SHALL verify users can only access features appropriate to their role
5. WHEN testing session management THEN the system SHALL verify user sessions are properly maintained
6. IF authentication fails for any role THEN the system SHALL report the specific role and failure details
7. WHEN all authentication tests pass THEN the system SHALL report successful authentication verification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that the JW.org download system is properly configured and functional, so that I can ensure automatic material downloads work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing download configuration THEN the system SHALL verify JW.org URLs are properly configured in mwbSources.json
2. WHEN testing download services THEN the system SHALL verify the JWDownloader service initializes correctly
3. WHEN testing material detection THEN the system SHALL verify the system can detect available materials from JW.org
4. WHEN testing download functionality THEN the system SHALL verify materials can be downloaded to the correct directory
5. WHEN testing file organization THEN the system SHALL verify downloaded materials are properly organized by language and type
6. IF any download component fails THEN the system SHALL report the specific component and error details
7. WHEN all download tests pass THEN the system SHALL report successful download system verification

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that the database integration with Supabase is working correctly, so that I can ensure data persistence and retrieval functions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing database connection THEN the system SHALL verify successful connection to Supabase
2. WHEN testing authentication integration THEN the system SHALL verify Supabase Auth is properly configured
3. WHEN testing data operations THEN the system SHALL verify CRUD operations work for all main entities
4. WHEN testing RLS policies THEN the system SHALL verify Row Level Security is properly implemented
5. WHEN testing migrations THEN the system SHALL verify all database migrations have been applied
6. IF any database operation fails THEN the system SHALL report the specific operation and error details
7. WHEN all database tests pass THEN the system SHALL report successful database verification

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that all automated tests are properly configured and passing, so that I can ensure the testing infrastructure validates system functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running Cypress tests THEN the system SHALL verify all E2E tests execute successfully
2. WHEN testing admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL verify admin-dashboard-integration.cy.ts passes
3. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL verify authentication-roles.cy.ts passes
4. WHEN testing system functionality THEN the system SHALL verify sistema-ministerial-e2e.cy.ts passes
5. WHEN testing PDF functionality THEN the system SHALL verify pdf-upload-functionality.cy.ts passes
6. IF any test fails THEN the system SHALL report the specific test and failure details
7. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL report successful test verification

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that all documented scripts and commands work correctly, so that I can ensure the development and deployment workflows are functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria
