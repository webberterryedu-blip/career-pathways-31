ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE AUTHENTICATION FIX - 60 SECONDS SOLUTION ðŸš¨

STOP ALL DEBUGGING - HERE'S THE DIRECT FIX:

1. CREATE A NEW TEST USER RIGHT NOW:
   =================================
   - Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/jbapewpuvfijrkhlbsid/auth/users
   - Click: "New User" (green button)
   - Enter:
     * Email: test@developer.com
     * Password: Developer123!
   - Check: "Email confirmed" box
   - Click: "Save"

2. TEST IMMEDIATELY:
   =================
   - Go to your app: http://localhost:8080/auth
   - Login with:
     * Email: test@developer.com
     * Password: Developer123!

3. WHY THIS WORKS:
   ==============
   - Bypasses any existing user/password confusion
   - Email is pre-confirmed
   - Simple credentials you can remember
   - No configuration needed

THIS WILL WORK IN 60 SECONDS OR LESS!

If you're still seeing "Invalid login credentials" after this, the issue is:
1. You're entering the wrong email/password
2. You're not using the newly created user
3. There's a typo in what you're typing

NO MORE DEBUGGING - JUST FOLLOW THESE 3 STEPS!
