🚨 FINAL AUTHENTICATION DEBUG - IMMEDIATE SOLUTION 🚨

YOUR PROFILE IS CORRECT:
======================
✅ Profile exists with correct data:
   - user_id: 1d112896-626d-4dc7-a758-0e5bec83fe6c
   - email: frankwebber33@hotmail.com
   - nome: Frank Webber
   - role: instrutor

BUT YOU'RE STILL GETTING "Invalid login credentials"

POSSIBLE CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS:

1. ❌ WRONG PASSWORD
   - You might be using the wrong password
   - Try resetting your password in Supabase dashboard

2. ✅ EMAIL CONFIRMATION
   - Your email is already confirmed (based on previous data)
   - This is NOT the issue

3. 🔄 SERVER CACHE
   - Your development server might have cached old data

IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:

OPTION 1: RESET YOUR PASSWORD IN SUPABASE
=====================================
1. Go to https://app.supabase.com/project/jbapewpuvfijrkhlbsid
2. Click "Authentication" > "Users"
3. Find your user (frankwebber33@hotmail.com)
4. Click the three dots menu > "Reset Password"
5. Set a new password you'll remember
6. Restart your server and try logging in

OPTION 2: CREATE A NEW TEST USER
=============================
1. Go to Authentication > Users in Supabase
2. Click "New User"
3. Email: test@system.com
4. Password: Test1234!
5. Check "Email confirmed"
6. Save
7. Run this SQL in SQL Editor:
   INSERT INTO profiles (user_id, email, nome, role, created_at, updated_at)
   SELECT id, 'test@system.com', 'Test User', 'instrutor', NOW(), NOW()
   FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'test@system.com';
8. Login with test@system.com / Test1234!

OPTION 3: CLEAR SERVER CACHE AND RESTART
====================================
1. Stop your server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear browser cache/cookies for localhost:8080
3. Run: npm run dev:all
4. Try logging in again

Try these solutions in order. The issue is likely with the password, not the profile.
